# Kotlin SOLID Principles

In this repository you'll find three payment gateway implementation with a bunch of code smells.
They could be code you inherited from a legacy code-base. Now you want to write unit tests for them, and that is harder than it needs to be. 
The gateways fail to follow one or more of the SOLID principles. 

## :pencil2: Tasks

- [ ] Start writing unit tests to cover the existent edge cases
- [ ] Refactor the classes if needed
- [ ] Take note of the code smells

## Principles

The following table is a quick reminder about the solid principles.

| Single-responsibility principle | Openâ€“closed principle | Liskov substitution principle | Interface segregation principle | Dependency inversion principle |
